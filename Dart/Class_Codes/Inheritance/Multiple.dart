//**Multiple Inheritance**

//Mutiple Inheritance doesn't work in Dart because when variables or methods are of same name then Child class of both Parent class will confuse which variable or method going to extend

class Parent1{
	
}

class Parent2{

}

class Child extends Parent1,Parent2{

}

void main(){

}
